          In this post, I’ll explain the functioning of the main mechanisms of the ships and 
          submarines that enable them to float and submerge (in the case of submarines).
        </p>
        <p class="article_content">
          <strong>How does something float</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="article_content">
          When you introduce something into the water you are basically moving some water to 
          replace it’s place in space with that stuff you introduce; so you basically need to 
          move the same amount of water that occupy the space you occupy. 
        </p>
        <p class="article_content">
          And to move something, you need to apply some force over what you want to move, and 
          water is no exception. So then, the amount of force you’ll need to submerge 
          something into the water (force given by the weight of the object in this case) will 
          be directly related to the amount of water yo need to move.
        </p>
        <p class="article_content">
          Or in other words, “the upward bouyant force that is exerted on a body inmersed in a
          fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid 
          that the body displaces”; and this is known as the Archimedes’ principle.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="article_content">
          So, if you want to make something float on the water, you just have to make sure 
          that the weight of the stuff is less than the weight of the water that it would have
          to displace to be submerged.
        </p>
        <p class="article_content">
          Another way to say that, is by usinng the concept of density. Density is the mass 
          per unit volume, so if you want to make something float, you have to make sure that 
          the stuff you want to float has less density than water.

          <strong>Ships</strong> 
        </p>
        <p class="article_content">
          So, following the Archimedes’ principle, for something to float is has to have less 
          density than water; but how can be a gigant piece of metal less dense than water? You 
          may ask; an the answer is in the shape of the ship.
        </p>
        <p class="article_content">
          The ship is designed in a way that occupies as much space as posible with the less 
          amount of material as possible to have less density than water. The ship does this 
          by letting a lot of empty space at the bottom.

          <strong>Submarines</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="article_content">
          As ships, submarines can float, but they can submerge very deep in water due to 
          something called ballast tanks.
        </p>
        <p class="article_content">
          Ballast tanks are spaces that can be filled with air that accomplish the same 
          function as the empty space of ships, wich is to decrease the density of the 
          submarine. But the difference is that this ballast tanks can let water go inside, 
          replacing the air to increase the density of the submarine and in consequence, 
          submerge.
        </p>

        </div>  
        <p class="article_content">
          The way submarines control the water that is inside, is by pushing air to the 
          ballast tanks to float or letting the air come back to it’s original place (due to 
          the water pressure) to submerge.
