                <strong>Fundamentals</strong> 
            </p>
            <p class="project description">
                Feminism by definition is the search for equality between men and women (equality before the law), so that 
                both have the same opportunities and freedoms.            </p>
            <p class="project description">
                The feminist movement was born at a time when women had different rights than men. That is, she had fewer 
                freedoms than men and this made her constantly abused by him.            </p>
            <img src="images/votesxwomen.jpg" height="100px"/>
            <p class="project description">
                On the other hand, in current times there is already equality before the law between men and women (at least 
                as far as westernized countries are concerned), and even a slight favoring of women in areas related to raising children.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>Feminicides</strong> 
            </p>
            <p>
                In recent months, movements have been made against feminicides, so that in the collective mind it is presumed to be a 
                significant increase in them or that they are simply very high.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The murders of women have increased, but they have done along with all the homicides, that is, not only the murders of 
                women have increased, violence in general has increased.
            </p>
            <p>
                But despite increasing, male homicides are still much higher, and therefore not as much importance should be given to 
                a specific affected segment as to the affected group.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, the word feminicide means "the murder of a woman by virtue of being a woman", which makes the matter 
                much more specific, that is, not every female murder counts as feminicide, but it must be murder specifically guided by 
                hatred of women, and therefore it is understood that the counted feminicides have been cataloged as homicides towards 
                women for hatred towards them. For this reason, attention is diverted from the true causes of said homicides since, a 
                person, even if he hates someone, will not attempt against him unless there is a strong reason or his reasoning is altered 
                in any way.

              <strong>Effectiveness</strong>  
            </p>
            <p>
                Feminism caricatures the man, accusing him of a potential rapist and deflects the true causes of crimes against women by blaming
                 him, so his measures cannot be effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, there are statistics that show how it is that in some countries where feminist groups have a greater 
                presence, violence against women has only increased.
            </p>

               <strong>Consequences</strong> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Recent feminist movements are mainly financed by George Soros, who aims to destabilize entire regions through them.
            </p>
            <p>
                It does this through its “Open Society Fundations” foundation, which basically works throughout America and Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, in addition to the economic losses that will be caused by the recent work stoppages, the long-term plan 
                is that these movements bring political instability in the different countries in which they occur.
