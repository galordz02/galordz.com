                The idea of creating this website came fom a course of personal branding that I took while starting at learning about 
                softweare. The original idea was to create a blog, but I decided that it would be more convinient to create a whole website
                to prove my web developer skills, and to have more space to show what I've done.
            </p>
            <p class="project description">
                First, I took some other courses about web developing, but one problem that I had was the missing information about how to
                making a website public; I mean, everything in the courses was about making the website files, but they never told how you 
                could bring those files to the internet; so I had to make a little research about it.
            </p>
            <p class="project description">
                So, I discovered that first, you have to buy a domain, wich is basically the name of your website. Then you have to acquire 
                a hosting, wich is the server(computer) where all your website files are going to stay. Fortunately, you can have a 
                completely free hosting if you don't have so much information to be stored.
            </p>
            <p class="project description">
                Finnaly, you need to link both, your hosting to your domain, and woala! You have a website that any person in the world can 
                visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, that's how I made this website; but this is really not the end, because there are a lot of changes that I would like to do.
